# ðŸ“š Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ (DSA-CPP)

This repository contains my implementations of essential **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in **C++** as part of my coursework at **Hawassa University**.

The project showcases a wide range of fundamental data structures and popular algorithms implemented with clean and readable C++ code.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Basic Data Structures implemented from scratch:
  - Stack
  - Queue
  - Linked Lists
  - Trees
- âœ… Searching Algorithms:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
- âœ… Sorting Algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- âœ… All codes written in **C++** with comments for clarity.
